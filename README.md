## Low- rank approximation of analytic kernels

This repository hosts the MATLAB examples for the paper *Low-rank approximation of analytic kernels* by Marcus Webb [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14017](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14017).

The file paper_figs.m produces all of the figures in the paper, in sequence. To produce the AAA-based approximations, you need to have [Chebfun](https://www.chebfun.org/) installed. To output the figures to tikz files you need the [matlab2tikz](https://github.com/matlab2tikz/matlab2tikz) package.
